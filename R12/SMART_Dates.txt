Brent,

from this below our piece is XXONT1927 - the pricing Interface.
Trying to make sense of the spreadsheet, especially the Target Testing Date
Completion of webTOPSS development (Brendan McArdle): 11-Oct
Functional Testing (Kadigari, Shyam) : 9- Sept
User Testing (Mandvikar, Shreekant) : 13 - Sept


Also, I'm not sure what she means by "when would you be ready to start importing new items?"...
This refers to another deliverable  : XXONT1950
XXONT1950 that creates Items/Cross reference/Catalog for a CTO Item from WebTopps is the prerequisite for testing of several downstream integrations.
"We need to get in touch with the WebTopps contact to know if there are any new items ready to be imported."...?

Currently I am getting a SUCCESS result with a $0 price back from the interface.
As of yet, I have zero effort on the webTOPSS code itself.

Going to get a clearer picture today on what is happening with the XXONT1927 and let you know what I find out.a

thanks,
Brendan
